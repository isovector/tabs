F#m             A            E
Forty-four's no age to start again,
F#m                        A                B
But the bulls were getting tough and he was never free of pain
D                                        C#m
Where others blew their winnings getting tanked,
F#m             B      A              E-E
Most of his got banked saving for the farm.
F#m                    A               E
He never thought she'd wait for him at all.
F#m                         A         B
She wanted more than broken bones and trophies on the wall;
D                                    C#m
But when he quit and finally got the farm,
                B         A                 E-E
She ran into his arms and now they've got a kid.
B                                 F#m              A
He was star of all the rodeos but now thet rob him blind.
        B                                  C#m         A
It took eighteen years of Brahma bulls and life on the line
B
To get his spread and a decent herd,
D                     A            E-E
But now he spends his time pulling night guard.

He told her that he'd got it for the game,

A "Winnie" 303 with his initials on the frame

Riding in the scabbard at his knee. Tonight he's gonna see

Who's getting all the stock.

Seventh one this summer yesterday;

Half a year of profits gone, and now there's hell to pay.

The cops say they know who, but there's no proof.

The banker hit the roof, and damn near took the car.

He was star of all the rodeos but now thet rob him blind.

It took eighteen years of Brahma bulls and life on the line

To get his spread and a decent herd,

But now he spends his time pulling night guard.

He hears the wire popping by the road;

Sees the blacked out Reo coming for another load.

This time, it's not one they take but two;

Two minutes and they're through, and laughing in the cab.

And here'll be the end of this tonight,

'Cause all the proof he needs is lying sready in his sights.

It may be just the worst thing he could do

But he squeezes off a few, then make his call to town.

He was star of all the rodeos but now thet rob him blind.

It took eighteen years of Brahma bulls and life on the line

To get his spread and a decent herd,

But now he spends his time pulling night guard
